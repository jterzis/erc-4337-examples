# Getting started

A collection of example scripts for working with ERC-4337. **For details on how to use this repository, [check out the docs here](https://docs.stackup.sh/docs/erc-4337-examples).**

The implementation for all commands are located in the [scripts directory](./scripts/). All scripts are built with the following open source packages:

- Sample contracts: [eth-infinitism/account-abstraction](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction)
- ZeroDev Kernel contracts: [zerodevapp/kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel)
- JS SDK: [userop.js](https://github.com/stackup-wallet/userop.js)
